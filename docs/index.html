			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Laver" target="_blank">Curator and fashion historian James Laver is probably best remembered for his creation of "Laver's Law."</a> Laver's Law attempts to categorize how clothing is perceived before and after it is in style. For example, it posits that an outfit might be considered "shameless" five years before it is fashionable, and "ridiculous" twenty years after its time in vogue.</p>
			<p>Laver developed this theory to help date old clothing coming into the museum, and, since he died in 1975, it's hard to predict how well the Law would translate to the modern, Internet-age fashionscape.</p>
			<p>Inspired by James Laver, I wanted to see if it was possible to unearth some kind of formula that describes the modern fashion cycle by computationally examining and clustering almost 300,000 similar-looking styles from runway shows between 1989 and 2014 using photos from the excellent <a href="https://fashionheritage.eu/" target="_blank">European Fashion Heritage Association</a>.</p>
			<p>The short version of this post is: I couldn't do it. More on why later. While the clusters I ended with are visually similar, they're not what most people would consider representative of fashion trends, so I'll hold off on publishing "Peter's Law" for now. Still, failure, like success, is rarely binary. Below are just over 1,000 images classified by computer to belong to one of 50 style clusters.</p>
